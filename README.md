# PROTEIN CODON changes

Annotation of paired or even continuous SNVs (including synonymous and non-synonymous variants)
located within the same genetic code requires attention. This idea conflicts with the annotations
observed by traditional annotation software widely used now a days (ex: ANNOVAR tool). While
looking at the combined effect within the framework of genetic code, we have new coding amino acid
predicted by using in-house python scripts.
